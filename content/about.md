## About Me

This is an example of how you can create additional pages in your Zola site. You can create new `.md` files in the `content/` directory and they will automatically be rendered as pages.

Some things you might include on an about page:

• Your background and education
• Professional experience
• Research interests
• Contact information
• Personal interests

You can link to this page from your main page by adding a link like `[About](/about/)` in your markdown content.
