## NumPy foundations

Notebook (download/open locally): [/kicsigeze/notebooks/02_numpy_foundations.ipynb](/kicsigeze/notebooks/02_numpy_foundations.ipynb)

## What you should get out of this

- Think in **arrays** and **shapes** (and stop writing Python loops)
- Master **broadcasting** and indexing (including boolean masks)
- Use `einsum` and basic linear algebra confidently
- Recognize common numerical issues (dtype, overflow, stability)

## Exercises (quick list)

- Implement batch cosine similarity without loops
- Implement softmax in a numerically stable way
- Implement PCA with `np.linalg.svd`
